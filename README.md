iPoliTO is a simple iOS app for the students of Politecnico di Torino. It is currently available on the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1069740093).

## Setup

In order to build the project, you must download and install the third-party libraries required by iPoliTO (see [below](#third-party-libraries)).

During debugging, you can choose to use your own student account (assuming youâ€™re currently enrolled at PoliTO) or a demo account (which will load fake data contained in `TestData.json`) by modifying a few lines in `Constants.swift`:
```swift
public let kDebugShouldForceCredentials = true
public let kDebugForcingCredentials = PTAccount(matricola: "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE", password: "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE")
// or use the demo account:
// public let kDebugForcingCredentials = kDemoAccount
``` 

## Requirements

* Xcode 8.0
* iOS 9.1 or above
